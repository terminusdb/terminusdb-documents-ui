Legend for the arrow types is a good idea

Non-critical link - necessary generator in place

Mitigated link - as there is an asset in place

Sub-asset - with maintanence schedule - timing into it

Keep track of sub-assets that are moving around -

Utilities - stand by systems -  uploads of data sent monthly by various bodies - need to have some automated script to eat a CSV and input. We can provide format I suppose?

Different style of pins for each critical stations have specific emojis

1. Enable date-limited access eg "access for the next 7 days".
2. When asking if an asset is "critical" - use "Yes" rather than "True" - just a more regular use of English
3.  The descriptions of the access levels could be a little less obscure
4. Can we color code map pins for asset status?
5. Can we use different shapes/icons for assets from different systems (comms, water, power etc)?  Will need a legend for this
6. Can we have a legend for different connector types?
7. Can we enable criticality to be changed on the fly - eg if a back-up generator fails
8. Can we create an Excel-based ingestion process?
9. Can we make the audit log for changes to data easy to surface?
10. Can we report assets by numbers of links?
11. Can we think about how to address multi-hazard, building on the Resalliance work we saw a few months back?
12. Can we create a report on users and access levels, and enable this to be printed?
13. We need a map of security workflows.
14. I did not see a field for spatial web coordinates alongside Lat/Long
15. We should probably create a powerpoint shell for the demo, for example setting out the use cases we will display (along with the security workflows just mentioned).
